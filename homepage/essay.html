        <h1 id="esti">A Tale of Pizza</h1>
        <p id="para">
            Since kindergarten it was a tradition with my friends to meet on the first day of school at Pizza Palace.
            If you wanted to be the coolest grade schoolers, this was a go to spot for many years.
            The best time I had with this place was when our parents allowed us to spend quarters on arcade games after we devoured our pepperoni pizza.
            During my younger years, ordering pizza on my own made me feel grown-up, and it gave me contentment for my younger self.
            Jose, the man behind the counter, got used to my frequent visit. No matter how busy he is, he has a never ending story to tell.
            He would often mention his goal of reaching his American dream. With so many stories from Ecuador, his homeland, I became interested in visiting it one day.
            Besides his amusing stories, I always get a free refill of orange soda from him. Since I started high school, I haven't had a chance to visit Pizza Palace.
            Last year, after a long day in school, I had a craving for my childhood pizza. It might have flaws but it evokes memories.
            I just had pizza for lunch but the urge to go to the pizzeria is because I miss my friends and the familiar food in my Astoria neighborhood.
            As soon as I walk in, the warm greeting from Jose brightens my mood. When you enter the pizzeria, the walls are all filled with pictures of famous people.
            The owner has a picture with Pres. Clinton, Mayor Bloomberg, and other famous people. It is surprising to think that these notable personalities had eaten at the same restaurant.
            In one corner of the pizzeria there is a claw game machine filled with stuffed toys, cheap watches, and oversized keychain prizes.
            A money sucking machine that is near impossible to win. I tried to master the controls of the crane - left, right, forward, backward, up, down, catch and release but I always failed.
            Besides the claw machine, one can try their luck on a vintage Pac Man game. Friendship grows while playing pacman because unlike the online game, it is an offline community game where real players meet in the arcade to play it.
            Moreover the irresistible smell of a crusty baked bread with gooey melting cheese and zesty smell of pepperoni flew across the pizzeria and filled my lungs with the richest smell. The initial deep scent is hypnotizing, provoking and surreal.
            <p id="para">Pizza Palace was less than a minute walk away from my previous school. It was an Astoria institution, a beloved staple of my community for many years.
                It is immediately noticeable due to its cherry-red and white striped facade on the striking corner of the street.
                The quaint looking place, holds a small town ambiance. From birthday parties, to special events in my community, Pizza Palace is our pizza universe. It is a community hub where we gather and bond with one another.
                Even though things always come and go, it’s sad to hear that my childhood pizzeria closed. High rents are forcing Pizza Palace to be out of business. The pandemic caused it to shut their doors permanently.
                I am afflicted with a sense of painful loss but laughing, sharing, and eating with my friends left lasting memories. Each bite of pizza shares something delightful. Pizza Palace is the soul of my community that allows people to have a deeper connection.
                Providing a space to hang out away from home and school. It is an expression of unity and strengthens friendships.</p>
            <p id="para">My New York is where change is inevitable and yet memories remain. It is where a deep-rooted smell of pizza leads to the memory of my childhood. It is a restaurant where I perceived a connection to the flock of Astorians that have the same pizza that I am eating right now.
                It is a never-ending energy that buzzes the claw machine and pac-man game. My New York holds something special to someone in every location, a city that is constantly evolving. You could notice an army of cranes that has transformed my city in recent years.
                The Thai Restaurant is now a sparkling gray steel. Mike’s Diner will give way to a Target Superstore. Local restaurants, just like Pizza Palace, are caught in the swift flow of time. A new towering building seems locked up by fortune replacing the old. It is a residential fortress that is isolated from the rest of us.
                You’ll be in seclusion up there. My city feels familiar but looks strange. My New York is a whole pie of pizza and not just a piece of it. With a variety of flavors that make it enticing. We all have different impressions of the city because of diversity.
                My appreciation and love for New York where I was born will never change. We might have different experiences but at the end of the day we are all New Yorkers.
